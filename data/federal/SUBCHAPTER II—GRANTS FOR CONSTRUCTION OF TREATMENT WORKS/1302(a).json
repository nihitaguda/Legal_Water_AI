    "text": "(a) Definitions In this section: (1) Eligible entity The term \"eligible entity\" means— (A) a municipality; or (B) an intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency. (2) Natural hazard The term \"natural hazard\" means a hazard caused by natural forces, including extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and extreme drought conditions. (3) Program The term \"program\" means the clean water infrastructure resilience and sustainability program established under subsection (b). (b) Establishment Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Administrator shall establish a clean water infrastructure resilience and sustainability program under which the Administrator shall award grants to eligible entities for the purpose of increasing the resilience of publicly owned treatment works to a natural hazard or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. (c) Use of funds An eligible entity that receives a grant under the program shall use the grant funds for planning, designing, or constructing projects (on a system-wide or area-wide basis) that increase the resilience of a publicly owned treatment works to a natural hazard or cybersecurity vulnerabilities through— (1) the conservation of water; (2) the enhancement of water use efficiency; (3) the enhancement of wastewater and stormwater management by increasing watershed preservation and protection, including through the use of— (A) natural and engineered green infrastructure; and (B) reclamation and reuse of wastewater and stormwater, such as aquifer recharge zones; (4) the modification or relocation of an existing publicly owned treatment works, conveyance, or discharge system component that is at risk of being significantly impaired or damaged by a natural hazard; (5) the development and implementation of projects to increase the resilience of publicly owned treatment works to a natural hazard or cybersecurity vulnerabilities, as applicable; or (6) the enhancement of energy efficiency or the use and generation of recovered or renewable energy in the management, treatment, or conveyance of wastewater or stormwater.

(e) Grant amount and other Federal requirements (1) Cost share Except as provided in paragraph (2), a grant under the program shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost of the proposed project. (2) Exception (A) In general Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a grant under the program shall not exceed 90 percent of the total cost of the proposed project if the project serves a community that— (i) has a population of fewer than 10,000 individuals; or (ii) meets the affordability criteria established by the State in which the community is located under section 1383(i)(2) of this title. (B) Waiver At the discretion of the Administrator, a grant for a project described in subparagraph (A) may cover 100 percent of the total cost of the proposed project. (3) Requirements The requirements of section 1388 of this title shall apply to a project funded with a grant under the program. (f) Report Not later than 2 years after November 15, 2021, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report that describes the implementation of the program, which shall include an accounting of all grants awarded under the program, including a description of each grant recipient and each project funded using a grant under the program.
